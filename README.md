## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of the Peace of Mind website is to provide users a tool for distraction from all of the everyday noises that they can use anytime and anywhere they like - as long as they have Internet access. 
<br>
The design of the website should also reflect the company's theme: the playful and loose look of the primary font combined with the background image and foreground colours of a tropical beach should put users in a serene mood as soon as they enter the website.
<br>
Peace of Mind has two target audiences: New and returning users and also potential new employees who want to help develop the website by, for instance, providing more sound effect clips and background videos that would benefit both the new and returning users.
<br>
Features include:
- Audio clips (of different sound effects such as thunder, rain, fire, crowd walla, keyboard typing, birds chirping, car driving, and so on) with basic music buttons (such as play/stop, volume, previous/next)

#### Developer and Business Goals

- A well-thought-out and professional design of the website that attracts new and returning users and also potential new employees.
- To create a website where the audio, videos and quotes are the 'stars'.
- A fun, creative and stylish project that reflects the developer's use of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the website should be one that attracts people who are in need of a distraction from everyday noises, not only with the help of sound effect sclips, quotes and background videos, but also from the playful and beach-like style that can be found throughout the website.

**Structure**

- When user enters the website (and before they land on the Home page), they are welcomed by a single question ('How are you feeling?') that is centered on the page in front of the website's thematic and monochromatic background (blue-green shade of cyan). Let's call this page the 'Welcome' pge. This 'Welcome' page acts like an introductory page for user and the question should tell the users immediately what the theme of the website is and also gives the users an opportunity for self-reflection. The question appears with animation effect where it is typed out one letter at a time and after 5 seconds, this 'Welcome' page transitions to the Home page in a fade-out effect.
- The header is always fixed on the top of all the pages of the website, containing the company name at the center and the navigation bar on the left- and right-hand side of the company name.
- From left to right, the navigation bar is in the order of importance. On the company name's left-hand side, you'll find the Home page and How To Use page. On the company name's right-hand side, you'll find the About page and Contact page:
    1. The Home page is the first page that the user lands on after the introductory 'Welcome' page and already here, users can find the heading and main purpose of the website: 'What sound(s) do you choose today?'. <br> Under the heading, there are icons that acts as buttons for the sound effect clips with basic music buttons (such as play/stop, volume, previous/next) surrounding the icons. Beneath each icon, users can find the name of the icons. These names represents the theme of the icon and the collection of their sound effects clips, for example the icon named 'Weather' has sound effect clips of rainfall, thunder, wind, etc. Users can combine a sound effect clip from an icon with a sound effect clip from any other number of icons. For example, they can combine 'Weather' with 'Nature' and 'Home' just by clicking the icons. <br> There are a total of five icons. On desktop and bigger tablet screens, the icons are placed on three columns on the first row and two columns on the second row. On smaller tablet and mobile screens, the five icons are placed vertically on top of each other. <br> Under the icons, there are three buttons placed (almost) next to each other on the center of the page, called 'Change background', 'Want inspiration?' and 'Reset all'. The 'Change background' button changes the background from the the website's thematic beach image to a random video that covers the entire background. With every click, the background changes to a different video. The 'Want inspiration?' button displays a random quote. With every click, the quote changes to a different quote. Users click on the 'Reset all' button when they want to reset the background back to website's beach image, stop displaying quotes and cancel all of the sound effect clips. <br> On smaller mobile screens, the 'Change background' button is removed and disabled in order to create less clutter on the page.
    2. The How To Use page is the second page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want instructions on how to use the Home page. Under the heading, there are two columns. The left-hand column contains an ordered list of the instructions and the right-hand column contains icons and buttons (intentionally, they do not work on this page). The purpose of these icons and buttons is to illustrate the instructions so each icon or button is placed right next to each numbered list on desktop and bigger tablet screens. <br> On smaller tablet and mobile screens, the icons and buttons are placed right under each numbered list, respectively.
    3. The About page is the third page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want to read more about who is behind the company and what they want to achieve with their website. Users will also find hyperlinks to the 'How To Use' page and 'Contact' page. <br> The About page looks the same on all screen types (on desktop, tablet and mobile).
    4. The Contact page is the fourth and last page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want to fill in a contact form to send to the company. The contact form contains the following fields: name, email, file-select and message. All except the file-select are mandatory to fill in before user can click the 'Submit' button. <br> The Contact page looks the same on all screen types (on desktop, tablet and mobile).
- The 404 error page have the same navigation bar with minimal number of text. It informs users that they have 'gotten lost' and can take themselves back to website by clicking on the button, 'Go back to the Home page'.
- The footer is always located at the bottom of all the pages on the website, except for the 404 error page. On the left-hand side, it contains the date of establishment to visualize the age of the company to the users along with the company's social links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. This date of establishment also communicates to users how relatively new the company is and how open they are for feedback and improvement. On the right-hand side, the footer contains the developer's disclaimer and LinkedIn page. On the Home page, the footer also contains the source link for the API quotes.
- All of the pages can only be scrolled vertically and cannot be scrolled horizontally.

**Backgrounds Images/Background Videos**

- The tropical beach image was chosen to represent main colours of the website. The tropical beach colours are typically equated with serenity and sets the overall mood for the users.
- The videos are used solely as background on the Home page when users want to change from the main background image to a video that suits their needs and chosen sound effect clip(s). The videos vary and go on a loop until the user either changes background or resets the website. The following videos that the user can flip through are of: aurora borealise, beach waves, car driving on dry road with mountains on a horizon, fireplace, forest, night sky, blurred people at an office, pink sky, rain on banana leaves, raindrops, close-up of book being flipped through, and sunset by beach.
- The heavily-green concentrated forest image is used as the background for the 404 error page. The 'Got lost?' text fits thematically with the background image. 

**Fonts**

- The primary font called **Reenie Beanie** attracted the developer immediately for its playful, casual and informal look. This look represents the theme of the website and can inspire users in a positive way. The font is readable in any heading sizes.
- The secondary font called **Montserrat** was chosen because it was one of the popular pairings according to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reenie+Beanie#pairings) but also because the design complements by primary font by being readable for paragraphs or for texts that are smaller than any heading.

**Colours**

<img src="assets/screenshots/for-readme/color-1.png" alt="Screenshot: Color #f2feff" >
<img src="assets/screenshots/for-readme/color-2.png" alt="Screenshot: Color #016d73" >
<img src="assets/screenshots/for-readme/color-3.png" alt="Screenshot: Color #299cab" >
<img src="assets/screenshots/for-readme/color-4.png" alt="Screenshot: Color #fc7844" >
<br>

- The white colour (#f2feff) was chosen for the company name, icons, hyperlinks, form and button borders, heading and paragraph elements because the white colour contrast well with the website's main background beach image.
- All the buttons are in a dark blue-green (#016d73) to match with one of the website's main tropical ocean colours. It is also the main background colour for the Welcome section.
- When the 'Change background' button is hovered, its background colour changes from the dark blue-green (#016d73) to the light-blue colour (#299cab), which is also a shade that belongs in a tropical ocean and therefore complements the blue-green shade of cyan colour well.
- When the 'Reset all' button is hovered, its background colour changes from the dark blue-green (#016d73) to an orange-red colour (#fc7844). This colour is typically associated with an action such as 'reset' or 'cancel' and therefore this colour was chosen by the developer.
- The standard red colour was used for the heart icon in the How to Use page, which is considered not a permanent element of the website but it makes the heart icon stand out and emphasize the positive feeling of using the website for the users.

**Icons**

- Icons were primarily used as sound buttons in the Home page to represent the theme of the different sound categories.
- Same icons were used in the How To Use page to illustrate how to use the Home page.
- Icons were also used for the social links in the footer element.

All of the icons were chosen because they are universally understood and because their obvious meaning and purpose removes the need for a more descriptive text.

**Music**

- The sound effect clips found on the Home page are the star of the website, it is part of the tool that is used as a distraction for the users from the everyday noises. The sound clips are played on a loop once the user presses play on the icon and stops playing when user presses stop or 'Reset all'.
- The sound clips are placed in five different categories: Nature, Travel, Public, Home, and Weather. Each category have 6 different sound effect clips, for example, Public has sound clips of crowd walla in an office space, restaurant and traffic noises.
