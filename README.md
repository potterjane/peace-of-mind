## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of the Peace of Mind website is to provide users a tool for distraction from all of the everyday noises that they can use anytime and anywhere they like - as long as they have Internet access. 
<br>
The design of the website should also reflect the company's theme: the playful and loose look of the primary font combined with the background and foreground colours of a tropical ocean should put users in a serene mood as soon as they enter the website.
<br>
Peace of Mind has two target audiences: New and returning users and also potential new employees who want to help develop the website by, for instance, providing more sound clips and background videos that would benefit both the new and returning users.
<br>
Features include:
- Sound clips (of different sound effects such as thunder, rain, fire, crowd walla, keyboard typing, birds chirping, binaural sounds, and so on) with basic music buttons (such as play/pause, volume, previous/next),
- Background videos (of beaches, forest, offices, sleepy dogs, fireplaces, and so on) that users can flip through with the help of a button,
- Easy-to-follow instructions on how to use the website,
- Social links to provide an alternative way to learn more about the website and to get more 'peer reviews',
- Contact form to give users an opportunity to send feedback or ask questions to the company behind the website.

#### User Goals

New and returning user's goals are:
- To understand the theme as soon as they enter the website
- Easy-to-use website with sound clips and background videos directly on the Home page
- Sound clips and background videos that can increase focus and productivity, decrease anxiety and stress, and improve mood
- A website that is not drowning in too much text, videos, music or images
- Clear and easy to understand instructions on how to use the website
- A page where they can read more about who is behind the company and what they want to achieve
- Get a sense of what users think of their website and if it lives up to the company's goals, for example via the company's social media

Potential new employee's goals are:
- Easy-to-use website with sound clips and background videos in order to know what the company's forte is and where there is room for improvement

#### Developer and Business Goals

- A well-thought-out and professional design of the website that attracts new and returning users and also potential new employees.
- A fun, creative and stylish project that reflects the developer's use of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the website should be one that attracts people who are in need of a distraction from everyday noises, not only with the help of sound clips and background videos, but also from the playful and beach-like style that can be found throughout the website.

**Structure**

- When user enters the website (and before they land on the Home page), they are welcomed by a single question ('How are you feeling today?') that is centered on the page in front of the website's thematic and monochromatic background (blue-green shade of cyan). Let's call this page the 'Welcome' pge. This 'Welcome' page acts like an introductory page for user and it should be obvious within seconds on what kind of website this is. The question should tell the users immediately what the theme of the website is and also gives the users an opportunity for self-reflection. The question appears with animation effect where it is typed out one letter at a time and after 5 seconds, this 'Welcome' page transitions in slide effect to the Home page.
- The header is always fixed on the top of all the pages of the website, containing the company name on the left-hand side and the navigation bar on the right-hand side.
- From left to right, the navigation bar is in the order of importance: Home page, How To Use page, About page and Contact page:
    1. The Home page is the first page that the user lands on after the introductory 'Welcome' page and already here, users can find the heading and main purpose of the website, 'What sound(s) do you choose today?'. <br> Under the heading, there are icons that acts as buttons for the sound clips with basic music buttons (such as play/pause, volume, previous/next) surrounding the icons. Beneath each icon, users can find the name of the icons. These names represents the theme of the icon and the collection of their sound clips, for example the icon named 'Weather' has sound clips of rainfall, thunder, wind, etc. Users can combine a sound clip from the 'Weather' icon with a sound clip from any other number of icons. For example, they can combine 'Weather' with 'Nature' and 'Home' just by clicking the icons. <br> There are a total of six icons, with three columns and two rows on desktop and tablet screens. On mobile screens, the six icons are placed with two columns and three rows. <br> Under the icons, there are two traditional buttons placed next to each other on the center of the page, called 'Change background' and 'Reset all'. The 'Change background' button changes the background from the the website's thematic and monochromatic background (blue-green shade of cyan) to a random video that covers the entire background. With every click on the 'Change background' button, the background changes to a different video. Users click on the 'Reset all' button when they want to reset the background back to website's blue-green shade of cyan and cancel all of the sound clips. <br> On mobile screens, the 'Change background' button is removed and disabled in order to create less clutter on the page.
    2. The How To Use page is the second page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want instructions on how to use the Home page. Under the heading, there are two columns. The left-hand column contains an ordered list of the instructions and the right-hand column contains icons and buttons (intentionally, they do not work on this page). The purpose of these icons and buttons is to illustrate the instructions so each icon or button is placed right next to each numbered list on desktop and tablet screens. <br> On mobile screens, the icons and buttons are placed right under each numbered list, respectively.
    3. The About page is the third page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want to read more about who is behind the company and what they want to achieve with their website. Users will also find links to the 'How To Use' page and 'Contact' page. <br> The About page looks the same on all screen types (on desktop, tablet and mobile).
    4. The Contact page is the fourth and last page on the navigation bar. Users click here when they want to fill in a contact form to send to the company. The contact form contains the following fields: name, email, file-select and message. <br> The Contact page looks the same on all screen types (on desktop, tablet and mobile).
- The footer is always located at the bottom of all the pages on the website. On the left-hand side, it contains the company's social links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn along with the date of establishment to communicate the age of the company to the users. This date of establishment also communicates to users how relatively new the company is and how open they are for feedback and improvement. On the right-hand side, the footer contains the developer's disclaimer and LinkedIn page.
- All of the pages can only be scrolled vertically and cannot be scrolled horizontally.

**Backgrounds/Videos**

- The blue-green shade of cyan (#7cc4a4) is the main background colour for all the pages of the website. This colour was chosen to represent the colour of a tropical ocean. This colour typically is equated with serenity and sets the overall mood for the users.
- The videos are used solely as background on the Home page when users want to change from the main background colour to a video that suits their needs and chosen sound clip(s). Therefore, the videos vary and go on a loop until the user either changes background or resets the website. The following videos that the user can flip through are of: beach waves, blurred people at an office, space, flowing rivers, city night lights, fireplaces, forests, close-up of book being flipped through, rain drops and a puppy sleeping.

**Fonts**

- The primary font called **Reenie Beanie** attracted the developer immediately for its playful, casual and informal look. This look represents the theme of the website and hopefully inspires users in a positive way. The font is readable in any heading sizes.
- The secondary font called **Montserrat** was chosen because it was one of the popular pairings according to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reenie+Beanie#pairings) but also 
because the design complements by primary font by being readable for paragraphs or for texts that are smaller than any heading.

**Colours**

- The white colour (#f2feff) was chosen for the company name, icons, form and button borders, heading and paragraph elements because the white colour contrast well with the website's main background colour of blue-green shade of cyan (#7cc4a4).
- The standard red colour was used for the heart icon in the How to Use page, which is considered not a permanent element of the website but it makes the heart icon stand out and emphasize the positive feeling of using the website for the users.
- When the 'Change background' button is hovered, its background colour changes from the blue-green shade of cyan (#7cc4a4) to the light-blue colour (#299cab), which is also a shade that belongs in a tropical ocean and therefore complements the main background colour well.
- When the 'Reset all' button is hovered, its background colour changes from the blue-green shade of cyan (#7cc4a4) to an orange-red colour (#fc7844). This colour is typically associated with an action such as 'reset' or 'cancel' and therefore, this colour was chosen by the developer.
- The links in the About page have a dark blue colour (#0388fc), simply to make the text stand out more against the blue-green shade of cyan (#7cc4a4) of the main background colour.

**Icons**

- Icons were primarily used as sound buttons in the Home page to represent the theme of the different sound categories.
- Icons were also used for the social links in the footer element.

All of the icons were chosen because they are universally understood and because their obvious meaning and purpose removes the need for a more descriptive text.

**Music**

- The sound clips found on the Home page are the star of the website, it is part of the tool that is used as a distraction for the users from the everyday noises. The sound clips are played on a loop once the user presses play on the icon and stops playing when user presses pause or 'Reset all'.
- The sound clips are placed in 6 different categories: Nature, Travel, Public, Home, Rest and Weather. Each category have 2-3 different sound clips, for example, Public has sound clips of crowd walla in an office space, restaurant and traffice noises. Rest has 2 sound clips of binaural sounds.
